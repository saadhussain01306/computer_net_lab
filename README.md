Computer Networks Laboratory @JSSSTU
Course Code: 20CS58L

PART-A: Implement the following using C++/Java/Python
1 A. Use appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical 
address, subnet mask, default gateway etc [hint: Ipconfig]. Explore 
different options available with the tool.

B. On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which 
the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, 
IPV4statistics, and IPV4 statistics etc. using appropriate tool [hint: 
netstat]. Explore different options available with the tool. 

2 Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques 

3 Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits). 

4 Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using 
bellman-ford algorithm.

5 Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the 
client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents 
of the requested file if present

6 Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the 
messages on client side, typed at the server side.

7 Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the 
data.

8 Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm 
and token bucket algorithm.

9 Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) 
congestion control algorithm.

PART-B: Simulation Experiments using NS2/ NS3/ NetSim or any other 
suitable simulation software

10 a. Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex 
links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find 
the number of packets dropped.
b. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a 
network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets 
dropped due to congestion

11.a Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic 
nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.
b. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less 
LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to 
transmission of packets

12.a. Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 
(Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment
b. Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 
(Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.
