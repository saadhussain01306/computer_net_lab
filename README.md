  <h1>Computer Networks Laboratory</h1>
  <h2>Course Code: 20CS58L</h2>

  <h3>Part-A: Programming Assignments</h3>

  <h4>1. System Information</h4>
  <p>Implement the following using C++/Java/Python:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A. Use an appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical address, subnet mask, default gateway etc [hint: Ipconfig]. Explore different options available with the tool.</li>
    <li>B. On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPV4statistics, and IPV4 statistics etc. using the appropriate tool [hint: netstat]. Explore different options available with the tool.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2. Frame Sorting</h4>
  <p>Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.</p>

  <h4>3. Error Detecting Code</h4>
  <p>Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).</p>

  <h4>4. Shortest Path</h4>
  <p>Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.</p>

  <h4>5. Client-Server Program</h4>
  <p>Using TCP/IP sockets, write a clientâ€“server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.</p>

  <h4>6. Datagram Socket</h4>
  <p>Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on the client side, typed at the server side.</p>

  <h4>7. RSA Algorithm</h4>
  <p>Write a program for a simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.</p>

  <h4>8. Congestion Control</h4>
  <p>Write a program for congestion control using the leaky bucket algorithm and token bucket algorithm.</p>

  <h4>9. Random Early Detection (RED)</h4>
  <p>Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) congestion control algorithm.</p>

  <h3>Part-B: Simulation Experiments</h3>

  <h4>10. Point-to-Point Network</h4>
  <p>a. Implement three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.</p>
  <p>b. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.</p>

  <h4>11. Ethernet LAN</h4>
  <p>a. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source/destination.</p>
  <p>b. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in a wireless LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to the transmission of packets.</p>

  <h4>12. GSM and CDMA</h4>
  <p>a. Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 (Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment.</p>
  <p>b. Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 (Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.</p>
