    <h1>Computer Networks Laboratory @JSSSTU</h1>
    <p>Course Code: 20CS58L</p>

    <h2>Part-A</h2>

    <h3>1. Host Information</h3>
    <p>A. Use appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical address, subnet mask, default gateway etc [hint: Ipconfig]. Explore different options available with the tool.</p>

    <h3>1. Host System Analysis</h3>
    <p>B. On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, IPV4 statistics, and IPV4 statistics etc. using appropriate tool [hint: netstat]. Explore different options available with the tool.</p>

    <h3>2. Frame Sorting</h3>
    <p>Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.</p>

    <h3>3. CRC-CCITT (16- bits)</h3>
    <p>Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).</p>

    <h3>4. Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h3>
    <p>Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.</p>

    <h3>5. TCP/IP File Transfer</h3>
    <p>Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.</p>

    <h3>6. Datagram Socket Messaging</h3>
    <p>Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side.</p>

    <h3>7. RSA Algorithm</h3>
    <p>Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.</p>

    <h3>8. Congestion Control</h3>
    <p>Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm and token bucket algorithm.</p>

    <h3>9. Random Early Detection (RED)</h3>
    <p>Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) congestion control algorithm.</p>

    <h2>Part-B: Simulation Experiments</h2>

    <h3>10. Point-to-Point Network</h3>
    <p>a. Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.</p>
    <p>b. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.</p>

    <h3>11. Ethernet LAN and Wireless LAN</h3>
    <p>a. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source/destination.</p>
    <p>b. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.</p>

    <h3>12. GSM and CDMA Performance Study</h3>
    <p>a. Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 (Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment.</p>
    <p>b. Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 (Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment.</p>
